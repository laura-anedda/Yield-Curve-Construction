# Yield Curve Construction and Analysis

In this project, we transformed **discrete market data** into a **smooth, continuous yield curve** using a combination of:  
- **Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic Spline Interpolation**  
- The **Nelson-Siegel-Svensson Parametric Model**

Through these methods, we derived:  
- **Discount factors** and **zero-coupon spot rates** via **bootstrapping**, ensuring robust and precise curve construction.  
  - **Euribor rates** were used for short-term maturities.  
  - **Swap rates** provided accuracy for medium- and long-term maturities.

## üîç Analysis and Insights

Our analysis explored various **yield curve shapes**:  
- **Normal**, **inverted**, and **flat**,  
interpreting their **macroeconomic implications**, such as:  
- **Investor sentiment**  
- **Inflation expectations**  
- **Monetary policy impacts**
