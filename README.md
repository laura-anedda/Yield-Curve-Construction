**Yield Curve Construction and Analysis**

In this project, we transformed discrete market data into a smooth, continuous yield curve using a combination of:
- Linear Interpolation, Quadratic and Cubic Spline Interpolation
- The Nelson-Siegel-Svensson Parametric Model

Through these methods, we derived discount factors and zero-coupon spot rates via bootstrapping, ensuring a robust and precise curve construction.
- Euribor rates were used for short-term maturities.
- Swap rates provided accuracy for medium- and long-term maturities.

**üîç Analysis and Insights**

Our analysis also explored yield curve shapes‚Äînormal, inverted, and flat‚Äîinterpreting their macroeconomic implications, from investor sentiment to monetary policy impacts.

This project highlights the practical applications of yield curve modeling in bond pricing, risk management, and economic analysis.
